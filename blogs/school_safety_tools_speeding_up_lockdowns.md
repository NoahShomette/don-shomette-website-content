# School Safety Tools: Speeding up Lockdowns

---

In a school district that I visited, I noticed taped to one wall in every classroom was a black X on a pink sheet of
paper. When I asked a teacher the purpose of this symbol, the teacher explained, “That’s where we hide during a
lockdown.”

This school district utilizes an easy to recognize control feature to speed up their lockdowns. This technique which is
impossible to miss is a tremendous benefit to new teachers, students, staff members, and substitutes because it does the
thinking for them—___hide here! This is the best place!___

I love the concept. It’s simple, super easy to understand and implement, inexpensive, and plays to our natural strength.
People are very visual and visual cues are great for helping to achieve specific behaviors. In this instance—it’s
speeding up lockdowns by reducing confusion.

If you think this might help your district, here are 3 points to consider before implementation.

1. __Continuity.__

   Whatever symbol you use—it has to be the same district wide. It cannot be school specific or you’ll risk creating
   confusion for subs, students who have moved up a grade level, or those professionals who bounce from school-to-school
   providing services to students at different grade levels.

   There must be __continuity__ or in other words, one symbol that is the same for _every_ school. Place this symbol in
   classrooms, copier room, offices, lunchroom, gym, locker rooms—any place where there are people.

2. __Perfect placement.__

   Identify the person who does your best school safety. Have them visit each classroom, study the room, and discern the
   best location for a HIDE position. Then mark that spot with your symbol. Be very precise when you mark the room. It
   must be the perfect placement because we’re telling everyone—__don’t think just run here!__

   The perfect placement is where those in the class can hide and not be seen or hit by gunfire from the classroom door.

3. __Simple language.__

   When implementing this new policy/technique, keep it very simple.

   “In the next few days, someone will visit your classroom, office, or space to double check or help determine the best
   location for a hide position during a lockdown. When that is accomplished, we will then mark that spot with a __black
   X__
   on a pink sheet of paper (eagle, mascot—whatever you decide to use).

   All you have to remember is that when a lockdown is initiated, regardless of where you are inside the school, __run
   and
   hide at the black X__.

   We’re doing this because it will make it easier for you to know the best place to hide anywhere in the building as
   well as speed up our lockdowns and therefore make all of us safer.”

Should you choose to implement this technique, be very visible when you do and let the staff know why you’re doing it—to
make the school day safer and our lives better.

Teachers will appreciate the individual attention and concern for them and their students! It will help to lower their
anxiety and at the same time increase their trust in the school leadership. This way you not only make your school safer
but you also enhance your school culture.
