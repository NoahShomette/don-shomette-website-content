<blockquote class="bg-gray2 p-2 mt-15 lh-lg bl-3 f-title-large b-colored"></p>
&quot;If I’m outside and the school goes into a lockdown, do I come back inside or stay outside?&quot;</blockquote>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This is one of the most common questions I get from elementary teachers. The quick answer is that when it’s a <strong>lockdown – stay out</strong>. When it’s a <strong>lockout – come in</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Because teachers are planners and it’s in their nature to want things listed out in a simple and easy to follow format, I’ve created a <strong><a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://donshomette.com/Recess_Procedures_Don-Shomette-Safe-and-Loved.pdf">1-PAGE SET OF RECESS PROCEDURES</a></strong> that that you can adopt and share with your staff.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Feel free to modify it as needed.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Last point, there is a hard and fast rule when preparing people to be successful in preventing or surviving violence. The simpler the procedures the better. The more organic, the more successful.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Organic means you take what a person would naturally do and then you show them how to do it a little bit better. You can certainly train a person to ignore their natural tendencies but it takes lots of time, training, and effort.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">None of which is necessary in this particular situation.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The procedures are very simple and very organic. When I’ve asked teachers what they would do if they were outside and the school went into a lockdown or a lockout, nearly every teacher has reached the same conclusions. Therefore, I don’t think you need to spend any more than a few minutes discussing these procedures</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You could probably simply email a copy to your teachers and encourage them to reach out if they need any clarification.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">RECESS/OUTSIDE PROCEDURES</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Inform the main office that you’re going outside.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Should a crisis occur, it is helpful for school leadership to know which classes are outside.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Bring a radio.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Cell phones are good but not as immediate as radios. With a radio, a person can simply push a button and talk. This will expedite help coming should you need assistance.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Do a quick scan.
Before leaving the school, stop at the exit and quickly scan the playground, parking lot, and any area close to the playground. Do you see any animals, dogs, people near the playground, or people lingering in the parking lot. If what you see concerns you, don’t go outside. Call for assistance.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Leave the building.
If everything looks fine on the playground, exit the building. Do not prop open the door. 90% of all school attackers enter through an open/unlocked door.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Share your radio.
When returning to the school, share your radio with the next class coming out if they don’t have one.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Inform the office.
Make sure to tell the main office that you’re back inside the building.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If a drill is called when you’re outside.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Lockout</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A lockout is ordered when there is a potential threat in the community, therefore quickly return to the protection of the building through the nearest doors.</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Lockdown</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A lockdown is ordered when there is imminent danger inside the building, therefore do <strong>NOT</strong> reenter the building but follow these principles.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Get away from the school!</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Go to your predetermined rally point.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you hear violence—go in the opposite direction.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If moving towards your predetermined rally point will inadvertently cause you to move closer to the violence—go in the opposite direction.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Once in your rally point or a safe place, take roll and call the district office. Alert them of your situation and location.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Above all, follow number #1.</strong></p></li>
