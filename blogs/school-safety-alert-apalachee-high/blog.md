# SCHOOL SAFETY ALERT

## Apalachee High School: September 4, 2024

I’d like to extend my prayers and deepest sympathy to the families of those who have lost a loved one, as well as to the innocent lives that have been destroyed and broken by this terrible act of violence.

Additionally, I want to personally thank the police officers, EMS, and all first responders who rushed to stop the attacker and assist the victims. Their swift and courageous actions undoubtedly saved lives, and we are grateful for their dedication and bravery in such a critical moment.

5. Two SRO’s are assigned to the school.

### What We Know/Timeline

**Prior to the attack:**

1. In May 2023, the FBI received “anonymous tips about online threats to commit a school shooting.”

### Conclusion

No one was “killed” at Apalachee High School. They were **murdered**. To protect themselves from liability the media will say, “killed” but that does not do justice to those who lost their lives or the families who lost their loved one.

They were not killed but **murdered** and there is no act more heinous than murder.

Those poor people and their families were viciously, violently, and permanently robbed of their most precious gifts by someone who had absolutely no right or justification to do it. The act of murder is so unjust that you can feel like a victim even though you were not there, don’t know the victims personally, or live on the opposite side of the world.

Therefore, when it comes to school attacks it is normal for you or your staff to be sad, anxious, and worried. Especially those who have school aged children or they themselves have experienced trauma and violence in the past.

If you can, try to be available, visible, and kind. You don’t have to be everything for everyone, just show them that they are not alone and that someone cares and trust me, that will be enough. **It will be enough and you will be enough.**

If you can, renew your commitment to preventing violence today. We don’t do school safety because we’re mandated or it’s a part of our job. We do it to save lives—to prevent murder so that no one has to suffer the insufferable again.

The stakes are so high because the price is so high.
