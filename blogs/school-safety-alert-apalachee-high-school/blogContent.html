<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Conclusion</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No one was “killed” at Apalachee High School. They were <strong>murdered</strong>. To protect themselves from liability the media will say, “killed” but that does not do justice to those who lost their lives or the families who lost their loved one.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">They were not killed but <strong>murdered</strong> and there is no act more heinous than murder.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Those poor people and their families were viciously, violently, and permanently robbed of their most precious gifts by someone who had absolutely no right or justification to do it. The act of murder is so unjust that you can feel like a victim even though you were not there, don’t know the victims personally, or live on the opposite side of the world.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Therefore, when it comes to school attacks it is normal for you or your staff to be sad, anxious, and worried. Especially those who have school aged children or they themselves have experienced trauma and violence in the past.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you can, try to be available, visible, and kind. You don’t have to be everything for everyone, just show them that they are not alone and that someone cares and trust me, that will be enough. <strong>It will be enough and you will be enough.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you can, renew your commitment to preventing violence today. We don’t do school safety because we’re mandated or it’s a part of our job. We do it to save lives—to prevent murder so that no one has to suffer the insufferable again.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The stakes are so high because the price is so high.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you have any questions or concerns or would just like to talk, please feel free to <strong>CALL, Text at 540-577-7200, OR <a class="colored underline-hover" href="mailto:don@donshomette.com">EMAIL</a></strong>. I'm happy to help.</p>
