<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Apalachee High School: Part 3</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Colt Gray attacked Apalachee High School on 4 September 2024.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">However, <strong>one week before the attack</strong> his family contacted the school and stated that they were worried about his mental health. In text messages between family members they describe Colt as having <strong>“homicidal</strong> and <strong>suicidal</strong> thoughts.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">His mother, Marcee Gray, stated that she told the school she wanted, “Colt to be admitted to an impatient treatment.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">She also stated that, ”Colt was on board with it.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Deborah Polhamus, Colt Gray’s grandmother personally met with a school counselor <strong>the day before the attack</strong> and requested help.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">After the visit, she texted a relative and said, “The boy starts with the therapist tomorrow.”</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Why is this important</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Gray was supposed to start therapy on the same day that he attacked the school. Is there a <strong>connection</strong> or is it just a <strong>coincidence</strong>?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When we insert ourselves into the lives of dangerous students we are also by default inserting ourselves <strong>onto their path to violence</strong>. We hope that our positive efforts will slow them down, provide stability, and get them to move backwards instead of forward on the Path to Violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">However, sometimes the school attacker will get nervous or afraid that the increased assistance and intervention is going to prevent them from carrying out their plan or that they’re going to be found out and stopped and miss their chance. So instead of slowing down <strong>they speed up</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Did this happen with Colt Gray?</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s well known that people who feel they are out of options are more dangerous. It’s certainly the case with animals—don’t ever corner an animal because they are more likely to attack you.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Gray’s family contacted the school one week before the attack. They requested he be put in inpatient treatment. His grandmother visited the school one day before the attack and was able to get therapy scheduled for the next day.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Without a doubt, Gray was coming under <strong>intense scrutiny</strong>, more <strong>accountability</strong>, and <strong>tighter control</strong>—all of which he needed!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">But to Gray, did it feel like he was running out of options—being cornered?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For the record, his family did the right thing. I will <strong>always</strong> side on the side of action and engagement, but we must consider how the student sees our intervention.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/kinkel/?kuid=66c31457-628d-4ad0-a9a4-630dd1eae54f-1735675542&kref=https%3A%2F%2Fdonshomette.com%2Fapalachee-high-school-part-3-out-of-options.html">Kip Kinkle</a> was also on the Path to Violence. He was planning and preparing to attack his school. He was found with a gun in school and everyone intervened in his life. They all did the right thing, but did Kip see it as if he was quickly running out of options?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The same day his gun was discovered, Kinkle murdered his parents after he overheard his father trying to enroll him in a military academy. The next day he attacked his high school. He was never planning to attack the day he did—that was never his plan. <strong>He sped up</strong>.</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Did the same thing happen with Gray?</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Important points to remember:</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>1. Try to See it From Their Point of View.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I was a cop, our one son was a cop, another son is a cop, and still my wife cries if she’s pulled over. She’s lived her entire life around them but to her, police officers can be scary.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Many people might not believe it, but for some young people and their families—principals, teachers, counselors, and social workers can be scary. Especially when they’re all together in one room and you’re sitting across the table from them after you’ve screwed up.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Parents can be scary.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Whether the student and the family has a valid reason to be afraid or no reason at all, we <strong>must consider</strong> how they see us and those trying to help. For students who are on the Path to Violence, it’s especially important to know because it could <strong>determine if and when they attack</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Just take a moment and ask yourself—how do they see it—how do they see my help?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you can, try to do anything and everything to lower fear and anxiety while increasing <strong>clarity</strong>, <strong>support</strong>, and <strong>hope</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>2. Give Options:</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you can, try to give options. This is a good strategy to use with any student, but <strong>especially</strong> for those who we feel are on the Path to Violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For example, a student comes into your office for any reason—give them options. You can sit in that chair or that chair. You can stand or sit. You can talk to me or Mrs. Sanders. The thing to remember about giving options is that you only give options that are <strong>1) safe</strong> and <strong>2) acceptable</strong> to you.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If the student needs to sit down, they need to sit down, but I really don’t care which chair they sit in. I want them to feel like they still have some options or control over their lives—<strong>even if it’s only a little bit</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If I need to have a student hand over their backpack, because it’s the safest thing for everyone, then the student must hand it over. However, I’d first try, “You can put your backpack on that chair or on my desk—which would you prefer?”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">People tend to do better emotionally when they have options. If you can, <strong>give them options</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>3. Go Fast and Don’t Stop:</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The moment that a threat is observed, reported, or discovered; you’ve <strong>inserted</strong> yourself onto the potential path to violence. <strong>Go fast and don’t stop</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The threat may think you’re just minutes away from stopping them and therefore they may expedite their attack. Even though the truth is that you’ve gone home because it’s 11:30pm and <strong>you have no idea</strong> who wrote the threat on the bathroom wall.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Because they may feel like they’re out of options, <strong>go fast and don’t stop</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>4. Adjust your security measures.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you send a student home, don’t be afraid to adjust your security measures.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The last thing they saw was how you have things set up. If they are on the Path to Violence then they would have planned and prepared to defeat <strong>those</strong> policies and procedures. If you can, make adjustments such as adding additional personnel outside in the parent and bus loop, park the SRO’s cruiser in a different spot, have the bus drivers step out of their buses and stand by the door as the students are getting out, and be much <strong>more visible</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">After a school attack in another state, I pulled a table up to the main doors and sat there all day. I drank coffee, did my reports, and personally opened the door for every person entering the building. I greeted them, talked to them, and answered questions.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If the threat returns to the building, the goal is to show them that things have changed and it’s not like it was when they left. <strong>It’s going to be harder now</strong>. You hope that it will force them to delay their attack because now they have to plan again or you give them such a strong message of ownership that they believe they won’t be successful and don’t even try.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you do this you will also send a strong message to your staff that you’ve got this, you’re <strong>taking it seriously</strong>, and you’re taking the necessary steps to prevent it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>5. Include the parents.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There is a long list of parents, wives, and other family members who were murdered first, before their loved one attacked the school. Please <strong>include the parents</strong> in your safety plan. Do whatever you can to make sure they are also safe.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I wish we knew how Colt Gray saw his intervention. I think it’s important in understanding what happened at Apalachee High School. Did he see it the way we saw it, as loving help, or did he see it as if he was quickly running out of options and had to act right now?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If I’m not being clear, let me say it once again—it is <strong>never wrong</strong> to respond, intervene, and attempt to manage students who may be on the Path to Violence. In fact, we have a <strong>duty</strong> and <strong>obligation</strong> to do so. We just need to be <strong>careful how we do it</strong> because these are not normal students. These students are planning and preparing to conduct a mass murder and what do, or don’t do, may make all the difference in when or if they try it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Engage, engage, engage—just be <strong>prepared</strong>, <strong>committed</strong>, and <strong>mindful</strong></p>
