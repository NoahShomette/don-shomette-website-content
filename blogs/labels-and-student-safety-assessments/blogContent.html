<h1 class="dark mt-15 f-display-small font-secondary ls-2">Labels and Student Safety Assessments</h1>
<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As a society, we have become terrible at spotting indicators of danger or those behaviors that reveal if a person is <strong>truly</strong> a threat. Unfortunately, it’s become common to label those with different beliefs, causes, likes, dislikes, and membership in certain groups as extremists, terrorists, villains, and threats.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In the past, these labels were <strong>only</strong> used when they truly applied and because of it, we were all safer. These labels served as a valuable warning to the community because they could be trusted and we could believe them.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Now, they are used too often to simply discredit, demean, cancel, silence, or to pressure the other person to think and act differently. This has made us far less safe because you can’t trust the labels anymore so most people simply just ignore them.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s the boy who cried wolf and we’re the villagers.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For those who work in a school with students doing threat or student safety assessments, we can never follow this trend or emulate society’s practices. We must be more objective, prudent, compassionate, careful, and absolutely rigid in our fairness.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">We must be like the wise person who, “Knows the true tastes of all things.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Centuries ago, this was the standard in which a person would be judged as wise. It has nothing to do with food but being able to draw accurate and truthful distinctions. Food was just a metaphor.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The valuable and wise person has always been the one who can label things properly. In other words, this action is good and that action is bad. This is statement is the truth and that statement is a lie. Your alternator is broken but your engine is fine. You need to take this medicine but not that medicine. This person is safe and that person is not.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When it comes to assessing students, I’m often asked who the person should be to make the decision about whether or not a student is a threat.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Typically, it’s the principal or a counselor, but it should be the person who knows the true taste of all things and it must be based on the <strong>student’s behavior</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It cannot be based on our own beliefs, prejudices, preconceptions, predispositions, or fear…all of which can be valid emotions. I’m not discrediting these feelings as much as I am saying that you must guard against letting human error blur something so important as making a proper assessment which at its very heart is assigning a student a label of being <strong>safe or unsafe</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Just hearing that phrase should make everyone shudder…<strong>assigning a student a label</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Society throws labels at people all the time without blinking an eye or seeming to care about potential damage it can cause to the person, their family, and our communities if they get it wrong.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">One of the best ways we can protect our students as well as ourselves from making a mistake, is to use the Path to Violence model.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Every school attacker anywhere in the world, has been on the Path to Violence. The Path to Violence has four distinct stages.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">1. Idea -&gt; 2. Plan -&gt; 3. Prepare -&gt; 4. Attack</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">These stages go in order from 1-4.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">First the person commits to the <strong>IDEA</strong> of violence and then they <strong>PLAN</strong> and <strong>PREPARE</strong> for violence and finally if no action is taken, they <strong>ATTACK</strong> by attacking the school.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The Path to Violence is only for <strong>targeted</strong> violence and not <strong>random</strong> violence. Every school attack is an act of targeted violence. A spontaneous fight between two students is an act of random violence. Both can cause great damage, but an act of targeted violence is potentially far worse because the person has planned and prepared to be successful.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The way to use the Path to Violence is to take a behavior of the student you are assessing and see if it fits on the Path to Violence. If it does, the student may be a threat. If not, chances are the student is not a threat.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There are of course exemptions, explanations, and mitigating factors that should be taken into account. The Path to Violence is not the <strong>only way</strong> to determine risk but it is a fantastic threshold to help you in the process.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Example #1</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The student draws a map of the school. The map highlights points of entry, targeted classrooms, and points of escape. This is clearly an attack map.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Does this behavior indicate that the student is committed to the <strong>IDEA</strong> of using violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Yes, absolutely.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Is this a concrete behavior of <strong>PLANNING</strong> to use violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Yes, absolutely.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Is this a concrete behavior of <strong>PREPARING</strong> to use violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No, it doesn’t seem so. Planning is thought and preparation is action. Therefore, this seems to fit better in planning.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Is this a concrete behavior that the student has breached the school property and is about to do violence—<strong>ATTACK</strong> the school?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Yes, absolutely.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Answer</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">From this piece of the puzzle, it appears that the student has at least committed to the <strong>IDEA</strong> of using violence and has take a concrete step in <strong>PLANNING</strong> to use violence (planned how he was going to enter the school, planned which classrooms to attack, and planned how he was going to escape). It does not appear to be a concrete behavior of the other 2 stages (prepare/attack).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Therefore, at this time the student appears to be on Stage 2 (<strong>Plan</strong>) on the Path to Violence which would indicate a potential <strong>threat</strong> and a <strong>medium risk</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Each stage on the Path to Violence represents a risk level.
Stage 1: <strong>low</strong> risk.
Stage 2: <strong>medium</strong> risk.
Stage 3: <strong>high</strong> risk.
Stage 4: <strong>critical</strong>.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Example #2</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A student has been repeatedly bullied. He’s a loner, plays first person shooter video games, and he often wears black.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Do these behaviors indicate that the student has <strong><em>committed</em></strong> to the <strong>IDEA</strong> of using violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No, not committed. He plays violent video games so there may be a fascination with violence but that does not make someone a threat.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Are these concrete behaviors of <strong>PLANNING</strong> to use violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No, there’s no evidence so far of active planning/thought to use violence.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Are these concrete behaviors of <strong>PREPARING</strong> to use violence?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Are these concrete behaviors that the student has breached the school property and is about to do violence—<strong>ATTACK</strong> the school?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Answer:</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">None of these behaviors fall on the Path to Violence. Yes, some school attackers in the past have shared these traits, but none of them are concrete behaviors that the student is planning or preparing to use violence let alone accept the idea to use violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Therefore, from these behaviors alone the student appears <strong>NOT</strong> to be on the Path to Violence..</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s important to note that if a student does not immediately fall on the Path to Violence, that doesn’t mean that you stop being involved or assessing the student. In this example, the student has been bullied and therefore is a victim in need of other services.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You would continue to care for them until they are at a better, stronger, and safer place.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When most people think about a threat assessment, it’s with the expectation that the student is a threat. To be fair, it makes no sense to do one if you think the student isn’t a threat. However, you must be open to the idea and absolutely resist the urge to place a label until you’re certain that it is as accurate as you can get it.</p>
