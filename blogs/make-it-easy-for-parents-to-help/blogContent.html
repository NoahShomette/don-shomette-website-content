<h1 class="dark mt-15 f-display-small font-secondary ls-2">Make it Easy for Parents to Help</h1>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Parents can be a great help in making your school safer. We just have to tell them how to do it. Like most people, including you and me, parents like simple tasks that are relevant, realistic, and most important—produce results. It’s a real energy drain to be given a task that is so big and squishy that you have no idea when you’ve accomplished it—if you even can.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">What I mean is</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Don’t leave it at just asking your parents to help make your school safe. That’s way too big and in truth, impossible to accomplish. Instead, tell your parents to do this one thing…</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Tell someone immediately if your child is afraid for their safety or the safety of someone else.</strong></p>

<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">That’s it. The task is relevant, realistic, and will produce enormous results. If every parent did just this one thing, we would greatly reduce violence in our schools and therefore make them safer—a lot safer. At least one student has known about an impending attack in three quarters of previous school attacks.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">That means we could have prevented attacks <strong>75%</strong> of all school attacks if someone would have just come forward!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If parents know what to do, and their part to play is simple and will make a difference, I have faith they will help us out.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">So let’s get them on our team!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’ve included a short letter to parents. Feel free to use it or to modify it any way that helps you!</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Example Letter</h3>
<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Dear Parents,</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I have one request and it’s an easy one. Please tell me immediately if your child is afraid for their safety or the safety of someone else. Other schools are suffering violence while students have seen something that scared them, but unfortunately didn't come forward to tell someone.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I don’t want that to happen here! We can’t let that happen here, but it’s going to take all of us working together.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’ve included a number (email, text, anonymous crisis number, etc) that you can call any time of the day. This may seem like a small part to play, but it’s a critical one and one that will make a big difference in helping us to make our school safer.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Remember, it doesn’t matter how ‘small’ it seems. If there’s even the slightest chance that someone will get hurt—I want to know about it!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Please don’t delay, but call immediately!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you have any questions, I’m always available for you</p>
