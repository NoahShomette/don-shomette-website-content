# Man Shot and Killed at Summer Camp

---

On June 13, 2022, at approximately 8:43 am, a man entered through the main doors of the Duncanville Fieldhouse, a sports
complex in Duncanville, Texas that is used as a summer camp for children. On any given day, there can be as many as
150-250 students present.

Inside the building, the man was confronted by a staff member. A conversation ensued and the man became upset. He pulled
out a pistol but it is unclear exactly what happened next. Some news agencies report that the staff member was armed and
that the two fired at each other. Other agencies report that the man shot at the unarmed staff member and missed. Either
way, adults helping at the summer camp heard a gunshot and sprang into action. A counselor near the violence quickly
closed the classroom door. The man tried to open the door but it was locked. He fired one round through the door and
then walked into the gym.

Police arrived two minutes later and immediately rushed into the gym. The officers confronted the man and shots were
exchanged. The man was hit several times. He was given aid on the scene but died later at the hospital.

No one else was injured.

With this attack in mind, I’d like to highlight a few points.

1. Violence has its own sounds—yelling, fighting, gunshots. Our staff members __must__ be reminded, taught, and encouraged
   to act without any formal lockdown commands. To trust their senses and to __act fast!__ If we’re only training them to
   wait for an official command to lockdown then we’re inadvertently training our teachers to be hesitant. Any
   hesitation works against us.

   The staff members at the summer camp didn’t wait for a command but acted ___immediately___ by closing the classroom door.
   Without a doubt, they saved lives. The room was full of children.

   Our staff members must be __prepared__ and __encouraged__ to act without commands!

2. After being denied entry into the classroom, the man didn’t destroy the door or use his body to burst it down. He
   fired a round through the door and moved on. ___This is what they all do!___

   They try the handle. If it’s locked, they shoot through the door and move on. If it’s not locked, they shove and fight
to get into the classroom. I do not know of a single school attacker any where in the entire world who stopped and took
the time to destroy a door.

   Therefore, add what we know into your lockdown procedures by giving your teachers these 3 priorities.

   1. Run to the door!
   2. Close it—it must already be locked!
   3. ___Get out of the way—because they shoot through the door.___

   Our lockdown procedures must reflect what we know of the threat—get away from the door!

3. There are lots of professionals who do not like the Hide aspect of Run, Hide, Fight. They think it’s too limiting,
creates a ‘fish in the barrel’ consequence, and that it doesn’t work as well as Run or Fight.

   Staff members at the summer camp immediately transitioned into a Hide. They put space (door) and therefore distance
between them and the attacker. It was the right thing to do at the right time and we know this from the outcome. No one
died. No one was hurt.

   Hide is an excellent option. It’s the strategy that most people use to survive school attacks. Depending on the
circumstances, another strategy may be better but that in no way diminishes the value of Hide. For some of our schools
there is no other option but to Hide. The student’s age or disability makes Run impossible.

   I will never advocate for only one strategy. However, we see again and again that Hide is extremely effective. Trust in
Hide…trust in your procedures.

4. Law enforcement arrived in two minutes, immediately confronted the attacker, and ended the event…within minutes!

   This is the norm. This is what happens almost all the time. Parkland and Uvalde do not represent law enforcement’s
response, dedication, or willingness to put their lives on the line for you.

   __We shouldn’t let the outliers override the rule!__

Confidence is one of those necessary elements that our teachers must have to be successful. The more confident they are
the more willing they will be to play a greater role. We must remind teachers and staff members that our police officers
will be there if trouble happens. They will run into the building. They will immediately confront the attacker. They
will immediately end the threat. They will put their lives on the line for them and their students.

How do we know this?

Duncanville, Texas…as well as so many other times.
