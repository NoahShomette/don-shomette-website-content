<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Discussion</h3>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">There are just a few points I’d like to highlight</h4>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>1. Review the <a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://donshomette.com/blogs/blog.html?blogTitle=school-safety-alert-feather-river-adventist-school">Feather River Adventist School Safety Alert</a>.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">These discussion points are applicable to this attack as well, especially point number 1.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The suspect in this attack took her own life before she was confronted by police. They found her on the ground and it is unknown or unreported if she had any remaining ammunition. If she is like all the other school attackers, she had the ability to continue attacking but took her own life instead reinforcing the fact that the threat is <strong>looking for victims and not a fight</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This horrible fact greatly raises our risk level and confirms once again that our response, efforts, and determination must be improved if we want to prevent these threats.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>2. This is Just a Drill.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A staff member from the school stated that when students practice a lockdown they are told, “this is just a drill…so when they heard 'lockdown, lockdown' and nothing else they knew it was real.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I recommend that you <strong>always</strong> call a drill a drill.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I would never do an unannounced drill. Yes, I would surprise the staff with a lockdown drill but I would always announce that it’s just a drill. Primarily I don’t want to scare anyone or create fear and anxiety especially when it’s not absolutely necessary or guaranteed to produce the intended results. There’s a better way to speed up lockdowns.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Implement the <strong>7 Second Lockdown</strong> and use <strong>progression drills</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Inform staff it’s just a drill and then count down from either <strong>17</strong>, <strong>12</strong>, or <strong>7</strong> seconds. The countdown creates pressure and forces the staff members to speed up which is the same purpose of not announcing it’s a drill. However, with the countdown staff members are racing to complete their critical tasks <strong>against a time limit</strong> instead of racing <strong>against the fear of it being real</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I worry about their emotional health and I never want to do anything that could make our teachers’ and students’ day harder, scarier, or more anxious.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The other great thing about mastering progression drills is that it will make you safer but it will also <strong>improve your culture</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Schools that <strong>clearly define a problem</strong> (not locking down fast enough) and then work together to achieve a <strong>clearly defined goal</strong> (locking down in 7 seconds or less) that can be <strong>easily measured</strong> (countdown) then your culture will be improved.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You have a problem. You came together to solve it. You solved it <strong>together</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Trust, confidence, and respect for each other enhances culture and the <strong>better</strong> your culture, the <strong>safer</strong> your school.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>3. No Names Until the Victims are Named.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s wrong that we know the name of the murderer before we know the names of the victims. The suspect’s family must have been notified so they released her name. They must be waiting to ensure the victim’s families are notified. I understand how it works, but I don’t like it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Victims always first</strong>—suspect second or not at all which leads me to my last point.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>4. The Hard Truth.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Violence <strong>must always</strong> be condemned. The suspect’s actions <strong>must always</strong> be condemned.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Without a doubt, the next school shooter is listening and will be influenced by what they hear or don’t hear. We have a <strong>chance</strong> to send them a message and our message as a society must be—this was wrong. You were wrong. You must not do this. We won’t celebrate or glorify you. There is <strong>never</strong> a valid reason to murder innocent people and we will <strong>never</strong> accept it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The more clear our message the better for everyone—including a potential threat. The more ambiguous our message—the worse for everyone—including the person considering using violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Some comments have been made and I’m certain that they were said in a spirit of kindness, empathy, and grace. The hard truth is that we must <strong>fully</strong> and <strong>unconditionally</strong> condemn the actions, behavior, and choices of the suspect.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As one person stated, “Every child, every person in that building is a victim and will be a victim forever.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Innocent people have been murdered and their loved ones will forever suffer. Anything less than complete and utter denouncement risks <strong>hurting</strong> the loved ones of the victims and <strong>planting</strong> or <strong>nursing</strong> a harmful and destructive seed.</p>
