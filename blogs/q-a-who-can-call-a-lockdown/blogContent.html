<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Who Can Call a Lockdown?</h2>
<hr />
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Question</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Don,</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">While discussing lockdowns, most of the teachers have this belief that the principal will be the ONLY person calling the lockdown. I think teachers are very conditioned to hear the building principal call the “lockdown drill” over the PA. What are your thoughts about having other administrators and/or staff in the building call the lockdown drill?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I tried to explain that anyone in the building that sees or hears violence can call a lockdown-if its plausible etc. I even explained that there may not even be enough time for a lockdown to be called in the event of an actual emergency and all we may hear is screaming and or gunfire. Not sure, if you have any stats on school shootings when a lockdown is actually called?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I have been told that the answer is no. This changes how we educate the students about what to do when they are in transit somewhere in the building.</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Answer</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This is a great question and before I answer it, I have to say it feels like things are changing for the better. Five years ago these kinds of questions didn’t come up. It’s good that we’re getting to the nuances of lockdown drills in a sincere effort to better understand them as well as to become even better at doing them. Absolutely anything that we can do to remove any hesitation or confusion from lockdowns works to our great advantage.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Every second saved is a life saved. It’s the key to stopping an active attack and saving lives—locking down faster and therfore locking the threat out of classrooms!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As far as the staff believing that the principal is the <strong>only</strong> person who can call a lockdown, I totally see it. Afterall, it’s always the principal who decides when to do a lockdown and it’s always the principal who calls the lockdown over the PA.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In one school I visited the staff figured out that whenever ‘Michelle’ got on the PA they were about to have a lockdown drill because it was the only time she got on the PA. Staff members are very observant and while we may miss something so obvious, they don’t.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m not sure if your school permits anyone to initiate a lockdown or if that is reserved for your leadership but continuing with only the principal doing it would worry me that if the staff members heard someone else other than the principal call a lockdown that it might cause them to hesitate. If there’s any chance of that occurring—even a moment’s pause to question its veracity—I would absolutely recommend rotating the people who call a lockdown. This will help to break this mindset as well as condition the staff members to get used to the idea that anyone can do it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As far as who is the person who has called the lockdown (if anyone) in previous attacks, unfortunately that is seldom one of those critical pieces of the puzzle that is shared in final reports. I can only think of a few attacks where we know the person by name or title.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In the majority of attacks it is an individual teacher who initiates the lockdown on their own followed by a command—if there is even a command. I think this is the norm considering 3 stats that we know of school attacks.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>10%</strong> of school attackers fight their way in (<strong>90%</strong> walk in through an open door).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There’s seldom an immediate or easily recognizable threat alerting leadership to call a lockdown such as breaking glass. Typically, the first clear indication of an attack is when the person starts their violence in a specific classroom and then like a wave, the classrooms nearest the event begin to lockdown on their own long before a lockdown is or can even be called.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>70%</strong> of school attackers are current or previous students.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">So many of the attackers are students they don’t stick out as a stranger so no one thinks to stop or challenge them and no one thinks of calling a lockdown because it’s ‘just a student’.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Approximately <strong>6 or fewer classrooms</strong> are physically entered by the attacker.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">We have a natural benefit to our schools—the size. Our buildings are huge making it impossible for someone to attack an entire school before teachers can lockdown, the SRO can respond, and law enforcement can enter the building. I think in many cases because of these natural benefits and perfected strengths that the event is over before a lockdown is called or can be called.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Should you choose to share this with your teachers, here are some principles and bullets that you can use to help to explain lockdowns and better prepare staff members. Modify or cut anything that will help you be more successful!</p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">When to Lockdown</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When the command is given—regardless of who gives it (school leadership or staff member).</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When the loss of life appears to be imminent. Anyone seeing, hearing, or sensing the imminent loss of life must call a lockdown. <a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://donshomette.com/blogs/blog.html?blogTitle=tips_for_identifying_potential_threats">SEE TIPS FOR IDENTIFYING A POTENTIAL THREAT</a></p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Extremely loud noises, shooting, screaming, and panicked people running in the halls.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Who should call a lockdown</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">During drills – <strong>anyone</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Focus on when you hear the word “Lockdown” and not the person speaking. As soon as you hear it immediately complete your 3 critical tasks.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Anyone</strong> – who believes the imminent loss of life is possible.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s not enough to just tell staff members that they have the authority to call a lockdown, they must also have the <strong>capability</strong> to do it. Some schools give their teachers access to the PA system but using the PA is not easy. For example, the person must pick up the phone, wait for a dial tone, then dial four numbers, wait for the PA to engage, and then make the announcement. In high pressure situations fine motor tasks prove difficult to complete.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If the technology permits, switch getting onto the PA to as few steps as possible. If not, allow teachers the chance to practice after school. They don’t have to call a lockdown just get on the PA and say something so they at least have the experience of doing it in order to feel more comfortable. The more self-assured they are that they can do it the more likely it will be that they will.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">How can a lockdown be called</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li>A button that initiates an automated lockdown message is a probably the best. Anyone can push it and it will automatically make the announcement as well as call law enforcement.</li>
<li>PA.</li>
<li>Phone app is fabulous. Then anyone can initiate it from anywhere in the building.</li>
<li>Voice—someone shouting.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">The 3 critical elements of a lockdown</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><strong>RUN</strong> to the door.</li>
<li><strong>CLOSE</strong> the door (it must already be locked).</li>
<li><strong>GET OUT</strong> of the way (school attackers shoot through the door.</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Actions can we do today to prevent the need for a lockdown</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Lock every door!</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Develop meaningful student relationships.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In 75% of all school attacks, someone like a student knew about it but didn’t say something. The better your relationships the greater the sharing of information.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Create, train, and utilize an effective student safety assessment team.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Commit to everyone being fully engaged during morning arrival (75% of all attacks occur first thing in the morning).</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Greet the students during morning arrival in the bus and parent drop off areas as well as at each entry point (helps to spot dangerous trajectories, control access into the school, and sends a positive message of ownership).</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Teachers stand in the halls and greet/supervise students during morning arrival and class changes (spot dangerous behaviors as well as makes it easier to immediately close your door should a threat be observed).</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Close your door during instruction time. Should the teacher choose to leave it open, then the teacher must be able and prepared to run to the door and close it immediately.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Your question brings up a great reminder that it’s not enough that teachers know how to lockdown when given the command, but they also must be able to do it on their own...without a command. The first part is easier than the second part but I know they can do it.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You can of course work on all of these things simultaneously. However, I believe that the priority must be for teachers to perfect locking down in 7 seconds or less. This is the one thing that will give them the greatest chance of success in an actual attack. If they have this solid basis then expanding their skills and abilities will be so much easier.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I hope this helped. Thank you for the question! If I can help in any other way, please let me know!</p>
