<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">Feather River Adventist School : December 3, 2024</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’d like to extend my prayers and deepest sympathy to the families of those children who were injured, as well as to the innocent families that will forever be emotionally impacted by this terrible act of violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Additionally, I want to personally thank the police officers who rushed to stop the attacker and assist the victims. Their swift and courageous actions undoubtedly saved lives, and we are grateful for their dedication and bravery in such a critical moment.</p>

<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Discussion:</h3>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">There are just a few points I’d like to highlight.</h4>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>1. They're looking for victims and not a fight.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The suspect took his own life prior to confronting officers. The officers didn’t report hearing a shot so he may have done it before they even entered the building. This is one of the few commonalities among school attackers—they’re not looking for a fight. <strong>They’re looking for victims</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This was true with the murderers from Sandy Hook, Dunblane (UK), Virginia Tech, Erfurt (Germany), Columbine, and many others. When confronted by police officers they took their own lives.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This reveals a great deal about the threat and <strong>if you don’t truly understand the threat</strong>, you are less likely to prevent the threat. The threat is looking for victims and not a fight. If you want to be successful, you must think, plan, act, and prepare with this in mind. <strong>You must perfect what you do and you must speed up your response</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>2. The threat that is closest to you is the greatest threat.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I have been doing school vulnerability assessments for nearly 30 years. Last year I completed about 25. Last year was the <strong>very first year in my entire career</strong> that I did not find a single exterior door handle unlocked. It has taken quite a bit to get here, but nonetheless that is a huge win for us and we should celebrate it. <strong>Well done</strong>!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As we get better at denying entry into our schools, and for the record, the threat for an elementary school is almost always outside and not inside the building, we <strong>must prepare</strong> for the threat to adjust to our safety successes.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The suspect faked enrolling a student so he could get inside the building. He’s not the first one to do something like this. The <strong>threat that is closest to you is the greatest threat</strong> because the suspect has access to the students and you have less time to react. When you have less time to act the more critical it is that whatever you do is perfect.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I don’t know if a lockdown was initiated or teachers locked down on their own, but we must perfect our lockdowns! It is our <strong>last attempt</strong> to thwart the threat, should it get inside the building and close to us.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>3. Reunification comes last.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You must have a reunification plan and it must be solid. Should you experience extreme violence, how you release students back to their parents will lessen or increase emotional trauma. It’s very important…however, it’s not the most important plan.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m not trying to minimize its value. In the last year lots of schools have been creating and practicing reunification. I would never tell you not to do so but I would tell you that <strong>reunification comes last</strong> so it should be the last thing you prepare after you’ve mastered the <strong>first things—saving lives</strong> (comprehensive and coordinated safety plan like Safe &amp; Loved, massive and positive engagement, tracking trajectories, reenergizing relationships, locking down in 7 seconds, student safety assessments, defining teacher neighborhoods, implementing 4 points of contact during morning arrival, lockdown drills in cafeteria, and staff training on spotting indicators of danger).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If I could only practice one drill—reunification or a lockdown—I’d <strong>always</strong> practice another lockdown. <strong>Always</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Saving lives <strong>must come first</strong>. If you perfect the former the latter (reunification) will be easier and less critical.</p>
