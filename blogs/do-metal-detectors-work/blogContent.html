<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m getting this question often because a lot of parents and others are wanting their schools to install metal
detectors. I know there is a lot to consider and I hope this helps you decide!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you want to make your school safer you must have multiple <strong>safety layers</strong> and <strong>filters</strong>. A safety layer is
something that
an offender must pass through or overcome and a filter screens for unwanted or dangerous behaviors. The more layers and
filters you have the safer your school. The fewer you have the more vulnerable you are.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Having said that…there is a tradeoff.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Metal detectors will require that you add or give up certain things.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Extra time.</strong>
Metal detectors slow down student entry. It takes time to get through the machines so it will add time to your
morning
arrival. It could be up to 30 minutes or longer depending on your level of screening, searching, number of machines,
and
number of students. It takes time to drop backpacks, take off belts, and put loose items in bins…if you want this
level
of screening. You can always reduce it but it will lower effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Trained and ready.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The people operating the machines must be trained. It’s not difficult to do but it will require training and several
designated personnel to run it each morning.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Wands and searches.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">These personnel must have wands and be proficient in searching and screening students. Inevitably students will set
off
the machines. When that happens you’ll have to pull the student aside and be prepared to wand as well as search their
person and bags. Again, it’s not difficult but it will require more time, training, and the right personnel. If your
teachers and staff members do not feel comfortable with this responsibility you will have to outsource it.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Prepare for violence.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The personnel must be prepared and ready for violence. Should a student have a gun, knife, or something else that
trips the metal detector—you will have to physically secure the weapon.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The goal is to stop these things from coming
in but what do you do when it happens? You’ll be face-to-face with a potential threat so the staff member must be
ready and able to handle it. Therefore, you can’t just assign anyone to
do it. This is one of the reasons why so many schools that have detectors hire outside security personnel to run the
machines. This alleviates the problems of training, wands and searches, and being ready and able to confront
violence. The tradeoff of course is the cost to hire these folks.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Change in culture.</strong>
Metal detectors change your culture and…not for the better. I’ve never seen a school’s culture improve with metal
detectors. Perhaps safety, but not culture. In my experience, I think it deadens the spirit of the students—it’s
depressing, starts the day off on a bad and unhappy note, sends a message of mistrust (metal detectors implicitly
imply
that at least some of the students are not trustworthy), and hinders the ability to form relationships. Metal
detectors
slow down morning arrival so there’s not much of an opportunity to greet and talk to the students since the
overriding
<strong>priority</strong> is not to welcome but to get hundreds of people quickly scanned. It is simply not conducive to warm
interactions.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If metal detectors were foolproof it would be easy to say yes to them but people can get around them. Like every other
mechanical device they are helpful but not perfect.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I was in one school where a student threw a gun up to a waiting friend hanging out of a second story window to get
around the metal detectors. In another school a student with a gun was let in by another student who opened an exterior
door for him so he could avoid being screened. In one school attack, a student with a gun ran through the metal detector
shooting the security guard and murdering him before running into the building and murdering 6 more people.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Last point</strong>—if you have severe safety issues, multiple guns found in the building, or repeated acts of extreme
violence
then you may need metal detectors. However, if this isn’t your school then most likely you don’t need them. Instead, put
your effort into people focused violence prevention techniques that multiply your safety layers and filters through
positive engagements and interactions with students. There’s no cost to it, no trade off, teachers love it, and you get
a safer, happier, and more successful school.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The greatest safety asset you have is your <strong>people</strong>—focus on them!</p>
