<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In an effort to save Wilbur the pig, Charlotte the spider weaves the phrase, “SOME PIG” into her web. Lurvy finds the message while feeding the other animals. He runs to Mr. Zuckerman and excitedly tells him of this miracle. Both men go to Mrs. Zuckerman and excitedly explain that “Our pig is completely out of the ordinary.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mrs. Zuckerman states, “It seems to me to that you’re a little off. It seems to me we have no ordinary <strong>spider</strong>.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For this fleeting moment in the book Charlotte ’s Web, there is a chance that everyone will recognize the real hero of the story—Charlotte. Instead, Lurvy and Mr. Zuckerman won’t hear of it and insist that it’s not the spider but the <strong>pig</strong> who is special!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">From that point on, all the characters see Wilbur as the hero of the story.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I feel like the same thing has happened with school safety.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you poll a thousand people and ask them to tell you what comes to their mind first when you mention school safety…they will say lockdowns and active shooter drills.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">These drills are not really school safety. They are our last-ditch effort to <strong>end the Chain of Violence.</strong></p>
<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">What is the Chain of Violence?</h2>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Using violence against an innocent person is a failure. Sometimes that failure is influenced by factors outside a person’s control and sometimes it is a willful and purposeful decision. Either way, using violence is a failure. The Chain of Violence is a cascade of failures where a person first <strong>accepts</strong> the idea to use violence, <strong>plans</strong> to use violence, <strong>prepares</strong> to use violence, and finally <strong>uses</strong> violence against innocent people.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">School safety is a series of proactive measures, techniques, and responses to end or stop that downward spiral of failures at the <strong>earliest</strong> opportunity.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For example, a student threat assessment is not simply an assessment of a student’s proclivity to use violence. It is a highly concentrated and coordinated effort to break the chain of violence.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Lockdown drills and active shooter drills are used only after <strong>every other</strong> school safety effort has failed.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s not that they are not valuable. Far from it. Anyone who has ever heard me present or read my blogs will see that I am a huge proponent of speeding up lockdowns. But they can’t be our only focus or even our primary effort. Yes, they must be perfected. However, engagement, character development, positive interactions, greeting the kids, great classroom instruction, helping in the halls during class changes, outside during morning arrival and dismissal, developing relationships, tracking student trajectories, immediately course correcting unwanted behaviors, boosting student growth—are all school safety efforts!</p>

<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">(This is school safety too!)</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If done well, consistently, and energetically, it will end the Chain of Violence <strong>before</strong> it even starts and therefore prevent the horrible necessity of sometimes having to take a life to save life.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">What I worry is that when it comes to school safety, we’re seeing Wilbur and missing Charlotte. That we’re losing sight of the real hero of the story which is breaking the Chain of Violence at its absolute <strong>earliest opportunity</strong> (school safety) and instead we’re concentrating on the <strong>end</strong> of the chain of violence (lockdowns/active shooter drills).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">All school safety efforts require effort, resources, energy, and commitment. I would <strong>never</strong> tell you to neglect perfecting your crisis drills, but try not to lose sight that the <strong>primary goal</strong> in school safety is to end the Chain of Violence <strong>before</strong> it can even start.</p>
