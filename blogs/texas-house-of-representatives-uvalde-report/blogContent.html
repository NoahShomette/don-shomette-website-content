<h1 class="dark mt-15 f-display-small font-secondary ls-2">Texas House of Representatives Uvalde Report</h1>
<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The Texas House of Representatives just released their fact-finding report. It’s approximately 82 pages and focuses on
what could and should have been done better by both Uvalde school district, Uvalde School Police Department, and others
who responded to Robb Elementary that tragic day.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s important to note that this is a good but not complete report. Those responsible for its completion rightly warned
that “Some aspects of these interim findings may be disputed or disproven in the future.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">To be helpful, I have broken the report down into 3 segments (Overview, School Details, and Police Response). If you
want to read the entire report, here is
the <a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088425-texas-house-uvalde-report">LINK</a>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’ve pulled out the details that I hope will be the most beneficial in planning and preparing for the next school
year—both for law enforcement and school districts.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m not agreeing with any of the conclusion—just consolidating what the Texas House of Representatives discovered and
offered as their conclusions. I will take some of these points and provide much greater details as well as
recommendations that you can use to mitigate some of these shortcomings or concerns.</p>

<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">OVERVIEW:</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Uvalde CISD serves a rural community of 15,217 citizens. The district’s schools include Uvalde High School, Morales
Junior High, Anthon, Flores, Robb, and Dalton elementary
schools, and several alternative education programs. (Page 17)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Robb Elementary School is for grades 3-4 and has approximately 540 students.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Teacher to student ratio is approximately 15:1.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The attack took place on 24 May 2022.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There was 1 attacker.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Prior to attacking Robb Elementary School, the 18 year old male attacker posted at approximately 11am on Facebook
messenger that he was going to shoot his grandmother.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A few minutes later, he shot his grandmother in the face. Seeking help and to report her grandson to the police, the
grandmother ran across the street to a neighbor.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">After shooting his grandmother, the attacker posted again on Facebook to a teenage girl he had befriended online that
he
had shot his grandmother and that “Ima go shoot up a elementary school rn.” He did not specify a school.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">11:28am the attacker crashes into a ditch near the school.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">11:31am the attacker arrives at Robb Elementary School.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">11:31am an SRO drives past the attacker and mistakenly confronts a teacher, who he thought was the attacker.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">11:33am the attacker enters the school through an unlocked exterior door.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">11:35am officers arrive on scene.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The attacker entered rooms 111 and 112, firing approximately 149 rounds.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">2:50 the classroom is breached and the suspect is killed.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">21 were murdered (19 children and 2 adults).</p></li>

<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">SCHOOL DETAILS/SHORTCOMINGS:</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>A regrettable school culture of noncompliance by staff members.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“…school personnel frequently propped doors open and deliberately circumvented locks. Administrators and school
district
police tacitly condoned this behavior as they were aware of these unsafe practices and did not treat them as serious
infractions requiring immediate correction. In fact, the school actually suggested circumventing the locks as a
solution
for the convenience of substitute teachers and others who lacked their own keys.” (Page 10)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>School district did not treat maintenance of doors and locks with the appropriate urgency.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Staff and students widely knew the door to one of the victimized classrooms, Room 111, was ordinarily unsecured and
accessible. Room 111 could be locked, but an extra effort was required to make sure the latch engaged. Many knew Room
111’s door had a faulty lock, and school district police had specifically warned the teacher about it. The problem
with
locking the door had been reported to school administration, yet no one placed a written work order for a repair.” (
Page 10)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Relaxed vigilance due to the frequency of security alerts and lockdowns.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Between February and May 2022, Robb Elementary had to lockdown approximately 50 times for ‘bailouts’ which is a term
used by border communities for the increasingly frequent occurrence of human traffickers trying to outrun the police,
usually ending with the smuggler crashing the vehicle and the passengers fleeing (bailout)
in all directions.” (Page 10)</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“A school district witness also testified to another effect of the rising prevalence of bailouts. The alert system (
RAPTOR) does not differentiate its signals between bailouts and other kinds of alerts, such as an active shooter
situation. The series of bailout-related alerts led teachers and administrators to respond to all alerts with less
urgency—when they heard the sound of an alert, many assumed that it was another bailout.” (Page 27)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Poor internet, poor mobile phone coverage, and inconsistent mobile phone usage which hindered the lockdown notice
being
received by teachers.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If the alert had reached more teachers sooner, it is likely that more could have been done to protect them and their
students. (Page 10)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Three exterior doors were unlocked.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As a result the attacker had unimpeded access to the building and once inside, had unimpeded access to the adjoining
rooms 111 and 112, most likely first entering room #111.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Locking the exterior and interior doors ultimately may not have been enough to stop the attacker from entering the
building and classrooms. But had school personnel locked the doors as the school’s policy required, that could have
slowed his progress for a few precious minutes—long enough to receive alerts, hide children, and lock doors; and long
enough to give police more opportunity to engage and stop the attacker before he could massacre 19 students and two
teachers.” (Page 10)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>The attacker most likely murdered most of the innocent victims before any responder set a foot in the building.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Of the approximately 142 rounds the attacker fired inside the building, it is almost certain that he rapidly fired
over
100 of those rounds before any officer entered.” (Page 11)</p></li>

<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">POLICE RESPONSE/SHORTCOMINGS:</h2>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>First responders failed to adhere to their active shooter training.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Since the 1999 Columbine tragedy, the law enforcement community has recognized the critical importance of
implementing
active shooter training for all officers, regardless of specialty. Also, all officers must now acknowledge that
stopping
the killing of innocent lives is the highest priority in active shooter response, and all officers must be willing to
risk their lives without hesitation.” (Page 11)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>School district did not treat maintenance of doors and locks with the appropriate urgency.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Staff and students widely knew the door to one of the victimized classrooms, Room 111, was ordinarily unsecured and
accessible. Room 111 could be locked, but an extra effort was required to make sure the latch engaged. Many knew Room
111’s door had a faulty lock, and school district police had specifically warned the teacher about it. The problem
with
locking the door had been reported to school administration, yet no one placed a written work order for a repair.” (
Page 10)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Despite the immediate presence of police leaders, there was an unacceptably long period of time before officers
breached
the classroom, neutralized the attacker, and began rescue efforts.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The first wave of responders included the chief of police and the commander of the Uvalde Police Department SWAT
team.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“We do not know at this time whether responders could have saved more lives by shortening that delay. Regardless, law
enforcement committed numerous mistakes in violation of current active shooter training, and there are important
lessons
to be learned from each faulty assumption and poor decision made that day.” (Page 11)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Chief of police (Uvalde Central School District) failed to perform or to transfer role of incident commander.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“The void of leadership could have contributed to the loss of life as injured victims waited over an hour for help,
and
the attacker continued to sporadically fire his weapon.” (Page 11)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Failure of communication and the relaying of key information.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Nobody ensured that responders making key decisions inside the building received information that students and
teachers
had survived the initial burst of gunfire, were trapped in Rooms 111 and 112, and had called out for help. Some
responders outside and inside the building knew that information through radio communications. But nobody in command
analyzed this information to recognize that the attacker was preventing critically injured victims from obtaining
medical care.” (Page 12)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Precious time wasted searching for keys and shields instead of prioritizing the rescue of innocent victims.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Instead of continuing to act as if they were addressing a barricaded subject scenario in which responders had time
on
their side, they should have reassessed the scenario as one involving an active shooter.” (Page 12)</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“An offsite overall incident commander who properly categorized the crisis as an active shooter scenario should have
urged using other secondary means to breach the classroom, such as using a sledgehammer as suggested in active
shooter
training or entering through the exterior windows.” (Page 12)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Radios were mostly ineffective.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Responders needed other lines of communication to communicate important information like the victims’ phone calls
from
inside the classrooms. (Page 12)</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Uvalde CISD police department failed to implement their active shooter plan and failed to exercise command and
control
of law enforcement responding to the tragedy. (Page 12)</strong></p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Someone else should have taken command or supplied leadership.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“Hundreds of responders from numerous law enforcement agencies—many of whom were better trained and better equipped
than
the school district police—quickly arrived on the scene. Those other responders, who also had received training on
active shooter response and the interrelation of law enforcement agencies, could have helped to address the unfolding
chaos. Yet in this crisis, no responder seized the initiative to establish an incident command post. Despite an
obvious
atmosphere of chaos, the ranking officers of other responding agencies did not approach the Uvalde CISD chief of
police
or anyone else perceived to be in command to point out the lack of and need for a command post, or to offer that
specific assistance…in this sense, the entirety of law enforcement and its training, preparation, and response shares
systemic responsibility for many missed opportunities on that tragic day. (Page 12 - 13)</p></li>

<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Last and perhaps the most important point.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you’ve been doing this for a bit you’ll see that everything labeled as a shortcoming or as a failed opportunity to
prevent violence is nothing new. We know what we need to do, how it needs to be done, and why it’s so critical that we
do the right thing at the right time.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It’s unfair to say that this is a wake up call. Schools and police departments know what’s at stake and are doing a
fantastic job and only getting better! This report however is a stark reminder of the importance of <strong><em>doing the little
things</em></strong> like locking doors and adhering to your training. Failing to do these will profoundly impact your ability to
prevent, delay, or minimize a potentially tragic event.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Give yourself and your school a chance to be successful—lock your doors and follow your training!</p>
