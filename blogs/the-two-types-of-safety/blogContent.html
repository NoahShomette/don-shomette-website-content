<h1 class="dark mt-15 f-display-small font-secondary ls-2">The Two Types of Safety</h1>
<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There are only two types of <strong>safety—mechanical</strong> and <strong>human</strong> (people).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Doors, cameras, gates, and locks are mechanical safety.
Your policies, procedures, and practices are people safety.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mechanical is a <strong>hard</strong> asset. People are a <strong>soft</strong> asset.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mechanical safety will <strong>stop</strong> an attacker from getting into your classroom. People safety will make sure the door is
closed and <strong>locked</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mechanical safety will <strong>deter</strong> an event.
People safety will <strong>prevent</strong> the event.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mechanical safety <strong>hinders</strong> unwanted movement.
People safety <strong>encourages</strong> positive interaction.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Mechanical safety creates a <strong>safer</strong> environment.
People safety creates a <strong>safer</strong> and <strong>better</strong> culture.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you <strong>only</strong> focus on perfecting your mechanical safety, your safety will feel cold, hard, and unfriendly. It’s
difficult
to be inspired by a camera or a metal door. It’s still extremely valuable…just not warm or inspiring.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you <strong>only</strong> focus on perfecting your people safety, your safety will be warm, engaging, and friendly but that alone
won’t stop a threat from getting into your classrooms. Your classroom doors must provide excellent protection.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Most schools focus on mechanical. However, mechanical is only as good as your people safety. Afterall, what good is a
great classroom door if the people using it never lock it or can’t quickly close it during a lockdown?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The secret to being safe is to have a <strong>robust blend of both types of safety.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">As you prepare for next year, continue improving your mechanical safety. The greatest improvement you can make is to
enhance your classroom doors (ADA handle, metal door frame, and small window with safety wire or tape).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Make this your mechanical safety priority!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Your people safety priority should be to inspire your staff to engage! <strong>Engage</strong> by blending in violence prevention
techniques (safety layers and filters) into every positive student engagement. <strong>Engage</strong> by perfecting lockdowns to 7
seconds or quicker. <strong>Engage</strong> by making the most of your mechanical devices by locking every door handle.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Make <strong>engage</strong> your byword for next year as well as your people safety priority!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Last point—mechanical devices are vital but your people are priceless. People are by far your greatest safety asset. No
mechanical device will ever outdo one vigilant, caring, prepared, and responsible person. People are the prize for
making your school safe and your teachers, students, and staff members feel loved. <strong>Put your effort into your people!</strong>
They deserve it, need it, and will amaze you at what they can do when inspired to see safety as something different,
holistic, positive, and in harmony with the goals of education.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you improve your people, I promise you’ll leap forward in safety!</p>
