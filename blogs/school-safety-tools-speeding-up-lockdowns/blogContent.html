<hr />
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In a school district that I visited, I noticed taped to one wall in every classroom was a black X on a pink sheet of
paper. When I asked a teacher the purpose of this symbol, the teacher explained, “That’s where we hide during a
lockdown.”</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This school district utilizes an easy to recognize control feature to speed up their lockdowns. This technique which is
impossible to miss is a tremendous benefit to new teachers, students, staff members, and substitutes because it does the
thinking for them—<strong><em>hide here! This is the best place!</em></strong></p>

<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I love the concept. It’s simple, super easy to understand and implement, inexpensive, and plays to our natural strength.
People are very visual and visual cues are great for helping to achieve specific behaviors. In this instance—it’s
speeding up lockdowns by reducing confusion.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If you think this might help your district, here are 3 points to consider before implementation.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Continuity.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Whatever symbol you use—it has to be the same district wide. It cannot be school specific or you’ll risk creating
confusion for subs, students who have moved up a grade level, or those professionals who bounce from school-to-school
providing services to students at different grade levels.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">There must be <strong>continuity</strong> or in other words, one symbol that is the same for <em>every</em> school. Place this symbol in
classrooms, copier room, offices, lunchroom, gym, locker rooms—any place where there are people.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Perfect placement.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Identify the person who does your best school safety. Have them visit each classroom, study the room, and discern the
best location for a HIDE position. Then mark that spot with your symbol. Be very precise when you mark the room. It
must be the perfect placement because we’re telling everyone—<strong>don’t think just run here!</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The perfect placement is where those in the class can hide and not be seen or hit by gunfire from the classroom door.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Simple language.</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">When implementing this new policy/technique, keep it very simple.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“In the next few days, someone will visit your classroom, office, or space to double check or help determine the best
location for a hide position during a lockdown. When that is accomplished, we will then mark that spot with a <strong>black
X</strong>
on a pink sheet of paper (eagle, mascot—whatever you decide to use).</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">All you have to remember is that when a lockdown is initiated, regardless of where you are inside the school, <strong>run
and
hide at the black X</strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">We’re doing this because it will make it easier for you to know the best place to hide anywhere in the building as
well as speed up our lockdowns and therefore make all of us safer.”</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Should you choose to implement this technique, be very visible when you do and let the staff know why you’re doing it—to
make the school day safer and our lives better.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Teachers will appreciate the individual attention and concern for them and their students! It will help to lower their
anxiety and at the same time increase their trust in the school leadership. This way you not only make your school safer
but you also enhance your school culture.</p>
