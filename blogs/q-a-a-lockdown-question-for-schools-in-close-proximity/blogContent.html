<h2 class="mt-15 f-headline-large font-secondary dark ls-1">A Lockdown Question for Schools in Close Proximity</h2>
<hr />
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Question</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Don,</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">We have school buildings next to each other that share the same campus. In your professional view, if a lockdown is
initiated at one building, what should occur at the other building on the same campus?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Please share your reasoning for this.</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Answer</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I looked at both of the campuses via Google maps and I think their <strong>proximity</strong> to each other is the key factor. They
are so close together that you could almost classify them as one campus with two buildings. Therefore, my recommendation
would be that <strong><em>if one would lockdown both should lockdown</em></strong>.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If there was anything separating them, I wouldn’t make this recommendation. My natural inclination in other situations
is that the school in distress goes to a lockdown and everyone else goes to a <strong>lockout</strong>. However, I keep coming back
to proximity plus human behavior and past experiences with school attackers. With these in mind, I would say that when
one goes to a lockdown—<strong>both go to a lockdown</strong>.</p>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">Here’s my reasoning in order of most to least compelling</h4>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The schools are so close that if a threat was observed outside, it would be extremely difficult or even impossible to
know for certain or even predict which school the offender has targeted.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">For example, there is a parking lot between School Number #1 and School Number #2 and from Google Maps I can’t tell
which school the parking lot belongs to. I’m guessing that both schools use it. If a guy with a gun was spotted in
that parking lot it would be impossible to know which school to lockdown and which one to lockout. By the time you
realized which school the threat was headed towards it would only take a few seconds for him to reach an entry point
and by then it would be too late to correct the response if you got it wrong.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This leads me to my next point—human behavior/limitations. The <strong>more confusing</strong> the situation the <strong>simpler</strong> the
drill (response) must be. The more complicated the response the higher the risk of failure. One school doing one
thing and another school doing something else is possible but complicated. You know your staff better than I do but
the leaders would have to be very skilled to effectively implement two separate responses for schools so close to
each other.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It is easier for the staff to train and prepare for one plan instead of two plans. “If they go to a lockdown we go to
a lockdown. If we go to a lockout—they go to a lockout.” That’s simple and easy to remember and implement.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">“We do what they do and they do what we do”.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It must be normal for staff members to see adults outside who they don’t know because they’re visiting the other
school. This has a tendency to create complacency with challenging strangers. I’m afraid the schools might be slow to
act simply because it’s so normal to see ‘strangers’ on or near their property. If this is true, then having multiple
drills may only slow their response even more.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">While it’s not the norm, 1 school attacker did try to attack multiple schools on the same day. The proximity of the
two schools to each other raises the risk of that happening to them. Therefore, acting as one will help to lower the
risk for both.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">Having said all this…</h4>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If one school has a past history of doing lots of lockdowns…when it hasn’t absolutely been needed…then I’d be very
careful not to inadvertently build in complacency in the other school which is forced to lockdown each time the other
school does.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Uvalde (the recent school attack in Texas) endured 50 lockouts/lockdowns in 5 months because of problems in the
community. As identified in
the <a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/22088425-texas-house-uvalde-report">TEXAS REPRESENTATIVE REPORT</a>, this
constant alert status without something visibly
happening in their school created complacency with the staff.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I would just watch it carefully and be ready to implement extra training/help if it ever looks like one school is
getting burned out because of the other.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’d encourage the schools to increase their communication with each other as well as their staff members.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If I were the principal and my adjoining school went into a lockdown—I’d push the button for a lockdown (whatever
method used) and then I’d immediately get on the PA and tell my staff (using plain English) that such and such school
has initiated a lockdown. Therefore, we are also initiating a lockdown. We don’t know yet what is happening. We will
find out and let you know immediately.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The better the communication the better the understanding and effectiveness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I think your situation is unique because of how close the two schools are to each other. Therefore, the best response
would be to mirror their responses. If one goes to a lockdown, they both go to a lockdown.</p>
