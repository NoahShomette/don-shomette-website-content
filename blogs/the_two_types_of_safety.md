# The Two Types of Safety

---

There are only two types of __safety—mechanical__ and __human__ (people).

Doors, cameras, gates, and locks are mechanical safety.
Your policies, procedures, and practices are people safety.

Mechanical is a __hard__ asset. People are a __soft__ asset.

Mechanical safety will __stop__ an attacker from getting into your classroom. People safety will make sure the door is
closed and __locked__.

Mechanical safety will __deter__ an event.
People safety will __prevent__ the event.

Mechanical safety __hinders__ unwanted movement.
People safety __encourages__ positive interaction.

Mechanical safety creates a __safer__ environment.
People safety creates a __safer__ and __better__ culture.

If you __only__ focus on perfecting your mechanical safety, your safety will feel cold, hard, and unfriendly. It’s
difficult
to be inspired by a camera or a metal door. It’s still extremely valuable…just not warm or inspiring.

If you __only__ focus on perfecting your people safety, your safety will be warm, engaging, and friendly but that alone
won’t stop a threat from getting into your classrooms. Your classroom doors must provide excellent protection.

Most schools focus on mechanical. However, mechanical is only as good as your people safety. Afterall, what good is a
great classroom door if the people using it never lock it or can’t quickly close it during a lockdown?

The secret to being safe is to have a __robust blend of both types of safety.__

As you prepare for next year, continue improving your mechanical safety. The greatest improvement you can make is to
enhance your classroom doors (ADA handle, metal door frame, and small window with safety wire or tape).

Make this your mechanical safety priority!

Your people safety priority should be to inspire your staff to engage! __Engage__ by blending in violence prevention
techniques (safety layers and filters) into every positive student engagement. __Engage__ by perfecting lockdowns to 7
seconds or quicker. __Engage__ by making the most of your mechanical devices by locking every door handle.

Make __engage__ your byword for next year as well as your people safety priority!

Last point—mechanical devices are vital but your people are priceless. People are by far your greatest safety asset. No
mechanical device will ever outdo one vigilant, caring, prepared, and responsible person. People are the prize for
making your school safe and your teachers, students, and staff members feel loved. __Put your effort into your people!__
They deserve it, need it, and will amaze you at what they can do when inspired to see safety as something different,
holistic, positive, and in harmony with the goals of education.

If you improve your people, I promise you’ll leap forward in safety!
