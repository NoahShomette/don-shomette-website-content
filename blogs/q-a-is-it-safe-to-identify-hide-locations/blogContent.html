<hr />
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Question</h3>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Don,</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">You suggested that we place a symbol in our classrooms to speed up lockdowns. We were told not to do that because it gives the attacker the exact location where the students will be hiding. We’re not sure what to do.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">What do you think?</p>
<h3 class="mt-15 f-headline-medium bold dark">Answer</h3>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">Background first</h4>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">This question is in response to the suggestions I posted in an article recommending that schools place a symbol inside each classroom indicating where the absolute best place is to hide during a lockdown. This will help new students, new teachers, subs, and those in the district who bounce between schools providing services to students to immediately know where the best place is to hide therefore speeding up lockdowns.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Here’s the link to that article <a class="colored underline-hover" href="https://donshomette.com/blogs/blog.html?blogTitle=q_and_a_is_it_safe_to_identify_hide_locations">SCHOOL SAFETY TOOLS: SPEEDING UP LOCKDOWNS</a></p>
<h4 class="mt-15 f-headline-small bold">My reply</h4>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Thanks for the question!</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m a firm believer that when it comes to school safety that we should be willing to have a healthy debate about our policies and procedures. Honestly, it’s too important not to. My lifelong motto has and will always be…test everything, keep what is good, and do no harm.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In that spirit, here are my reasons why I would still mark each classroom. They’re listed from most to least compelling.</p>
<ol class="list-number list list-lg list-disc mt-30 gray7 f-body-large dark">
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">It benefits us the most.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I’m often asked by schools if they should share what they do during a lockdown in fear that an attacker will get the info and then use it against the school. My reply is always the same…if an attacker knew the details of your plan which details would you change?</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">After a few minutes of discussion, we always reach the same conclusion—nothing. We wouldn’t change anything because we have the best plan and to choose something less beneficial in order to keep it from the school attacker would be counterproductive.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The same is true for marking hide locations.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Even if school attackers knew each hide location, we would never then select a new or inferior hide location in order to keep it from them. <strong>Basically, an attacker knowing doesn’t change anything</strong>. However, if we mark the best locations it will help to reduce confusion and therefore speed up our lockdowns as well as give new students, new teachers, subs, and district personnel who visit multiple schools the ability to immediately identify the best place to hide in each space.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I don’t like attackers knowing <strong><em>anything</em></strong> about our plans or where we would hide but I think the benefits of marking the best hide locations far outweighs any potential disadvantages.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Past lessons learned.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">A long time ago we used color and code words to indicate certain drills. We did this so the attacker wouldn’t know what we were doing. We stopped doing it and instead chose to use plain English because the code words and colors were confusing and therefore it slowed our response making us less safe.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Confusion benefits the attacker.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I remember when we switched. I remember the discussions, arguments, and debates. There was a real concern that by going to plain English that we would be telling the attacker exactly what we were doing. We weighed it very carefully and concluded that switching would in fact raise the risk level some but at the same time lower our vulnerability more.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">In the beginning, the code words and colors were needed but it was smart to switch.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Marking the hide locations is very similar to this past situation. We’re revealing more of what we’re doing which can increase the risk but anything we do to speed up our response, like getting rid of code words and colors, is to our benefit. This past lesson learned really helps to persuade me that marking hide locations is also the right course of action because when we simplify our response we increase our chances for success.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">They probably know already.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">70% of all school attackers are current or previous students. Chances are they already know our hide locations so it’s not that guarded of a secret.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The door is the critical factor.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">During a lockdown, if the teacher immediately 1) <strong>runs</strong> to the door, 2) <strong>closes</strong> the door (must already be locked), and 3) <strong>gets away</strong> from the door…there is an astronomical chance (95% or greater) that the attacker will never enter the classroom. It’s not that hide locations are not important but closing and locking the door is critical.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15"><strong>Focus on the door!</strong></p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">If the door is closed before the attacker can enter the classroom then the attacker knowing the location of the hide is immaterial. This isn’t meant to diminish the value of a hide location but instead to emphasize that in a lockdown the door is the critical factor—above all else.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">The attacker knowing the hiding spots doesn’t matter if the door is locked. Focus on the door!</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Everything is about time.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Every second saved is a life saved. If marking the hide locations speeds up lockdowns by even a few seconds—that’s a win. Absolutely do it.</p></li>
<li><p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Realistic outcomes.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">No one ever became a teacher to do school safety. Anything that we can do to make it easier for them to be more successful—we should do it. Marking the hide locations will make it a little bit easier.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">Every violence prevention technique, method, strategy, or principle comes with negative and positive consequences. We often forget this inescapable fact—that sometimes doing something positive may come with an inherent negative. Marking the hide locations will raise the risk level but only slightly while the positives gained from this action overwhelm any potential negative.</p>
<p class="f-body-large gray9 mt-15">I hope this helps!</p>
