# 3 Ways to Make Your School Year Safer

---

It’s difficult to be assertive when you’re confused. The simpler the message, the easier it is to remember and
implement. It helps a great deal to keep your vision for a safer school set on 3 or fewer points that are simple in
scope.

With that in mind, I recommend that this year you focus on 3 big yearly goals that when accomplished will positively
impact ___everything___ else.

1. Engage more.
2. Lock every door.
3. Speed up our lockdowns.

#### Engage More.

We need this. Not only for our mental, emotional, and physical health but also for our school safety. The more that
teachers engage with students the better the relationships. The better the relationships the greater the communications.
The greater the communications the more trusting our students will be and therefore the more likely they will be to
share information about fellow students who need help or who are showing signs of danger.

Our teachers and staff members also need this—they need to engage with each other and as Tony Shay says, “To collide
together.” Every person is the hero of their own story. They are a world of their own. When they collide—engage with
each other it’s truly a powerful thing that is both extremely good and absolutely necessary for creating a warm,
positive, and safe culture.

Engage, engage, above all __engage__ this year!

#### Lock every door.

Every door handle must be locked—treat it as a non-negotiable. There are a few valid reasons to hold or even prop open a
door but there is never a valid reason to leave a door handle unlocked. We must master this. We must get beyond this
very simple but critical task. Every door must be locked!

90% of all school attackers enter through an unlocked/open door. What would happen if we locked our doors?

At Uvalde, the attacker entered through an unlocked/open exterior door and then entered a classroom door that couldn’t
even lock. I can’t for certain say what would have happened if these doors would have been locked, but I can say with
absolute certainty that Uvalde would have ended differently. __Guaranteed.__

#### Speed up our lockdowns.

On average, teachers take 38 seconds to lockdown. This is entirely too slow. We must speed up our lockdowns. I’m happy
to give you all the materials for the 7 Second Lockdown. Very soon there will be a series of videos online that you can
share with your teachers to help you explain as well as implement it. Until then, when you practice your drills
reinforce these 3 critical teacher tasks.

1. __RUN__ to the door.
2. __CLOSE__ the door (it must already be locked).
3. __GET OUT__ of the way (school attackers shoot through the door.

If you want to add additional steps you can. However, these are the 3 critical tasks that must be accomplished
regardless of whatever else the teacher is asked or required to do.

Do these three things—especially __RUN__ to the door and I promise you will speed up your lockdowns.

Adopt these 3 goals to make your school safer this year. Share them with your teachers and staff members. Post them in
classrooms, repeat them often, routinely check for success and compliance. You can never repeat them too often. As the
philosopher Marcus Aurelius stated nearly two centuries ago, “People don’t need to be told what to do…they need to be
reminded what to do.”

Remind your teachers and staff members to do these three things and in doing so you will help them to be safer, less
anxious, more confident, and therefore they will enjoy a higher quality of life.
