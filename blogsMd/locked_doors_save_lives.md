# Locked Doors Save Lives

---

A few days ago (June 9,2022), a man tried to enter Walnut Park Elementary School in Gadsden, Alabama. He tried at least
two doors but couldn’t get in. Inside were approximately 34 students participating in a literacy summer camp. The school
went to a lockdown and called police. The SRO responded immediately and found the man trying to make forcible entry into
a marked police car near the school. When confronted, a fight ensued and the man attempted to wrestle away the officer’s
gun. The officer called for assistance. Another officer arrived and the man was shot and pronounced dead at the scene.
The SRO was treated for minor injuries and released.

There is no word if the man had a gun or what his intentions were with the school. There are a lot of things that are
unknown. I’d like to focus on what is known.

Someone tried to enter the school and was stopped because the doors were locked.

Keeping your doors locked is called exterior access control and it’s one of the 3 things you must do to keep your school
safe. You must 1) __supervise__ your space and the people in the space, 2) __control__ who can enter and leave your space (
access control), and 3) you must clearly define your boundaries and in doing so help to send a very clear message of
__ownership__. __Ownership__ tells potential offenders that you care about what happens here, you won’t allow any unwanted
behavior, and you’re not an easy target.

There is also interior access control. That’s locking your inside doors like classrooms.

A locked door is a __layer__ of safety. The more layers you have the safer your school. A layer is something that an
offender must contend with or overcome. All layers are not the same. Your staff wearing a badge is a layer of safety but
it’s nothing like a locked door. A locked exterior door or a locked classroom door is one of your best layers and here
we see its true value. A person was stopped from entering the school. We don’t know yet what he wanted, his intentions,
or why he was trying to get in. We don’t even know if his purpose was nefarious. ___We just know he was stopped by locked
doors.___

The threat that is closest to you is the greatest threat. Locked doors provide you with __space__ (an object) and __distance__
from potential danger. I know it seems simple and sometimes a pain in the neck to lock doors, especially with young
children, but the reward far outweighs the hassle.
