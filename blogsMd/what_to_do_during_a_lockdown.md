# What to do During a Lockdown

---

We teach our staff how to lock down, we practice locking down, but we don’t tell teachers what to do __during__ a
lockdown or what to have ready for a lockdown. While this is a difficult topic, each time I’ve had this conversation
with teachers it has been extremely well received and appreciated. After all, teachers are planners and they like to be
prepared.

Here are some tips and ideas for __during__ a lockdown.

1. After you’ve implemented a lockdown, continue to assess and re-evaluate. If you can maintain __space__ (an object
   such as a door or wall) and __distance__ between you and violence then chances are you do not need to transition to
   RUN or into another HIDE location. If you __CANNOT__ maintain space and distance then start planning and preparing to
   transition if necessary (the threat is trying to breach your room/hide location and it appears that they may be able
   to).

   If you must __RUN__ consider going out the window or away from the building. This provides excellent space and
   distance.

2. Remain close to the students—your physical presence will do a great deal to reassure them and lower anxiety. They
   love and trust you!

3. Try to lower your own heart rate by breathing in through your nose for four seconds—holding it for four seconds—and
   then releasing it for four seconds. This will lower your heart rate and help you to make better decisions.

4. Lead your students through this same breathing exercise.

5. Monitor the students with their phones. Unbelievably, media personnel have DM’d students during active school attacks
   via social media platforms in an effort to get information.

(Example from Parkland, 2016)

1. __Noise__ and __movement__ attract attention so try to limit both. However, if you have students who cannot be quiet
   have them talk or yell into small pillows, stuffed animals, jackets, or other items that absorb sound.

2. If you have students who physically cannot remain seated or still, create a ‘safety zone’ and let them walk or pace
   as long as they do not exit this zone.

   A safety zone is an area for students who cannot sit still and must walk or pace. It is the area hidden from view
   from the classroom door as well as protected from gunfire. This is typically your hide spot. You can quickly arrange
   desks or chairs as a boundary line as long as you do not exit the zone yourself. You can also pre-mark the floor with
   small strips of tape and then just tell the students, “You can pace, stand, or walk here but do not cross the tape (
   chairs/desks).”

   This should only be used for those students who are emotionally or physically incapable of remaining still. For these
   students it may be necessary and beneficial to provide controlled release for their needs.
   Below are suggestions for ways to help calm, focus, or assist students. Pick and choose the ones that you feel are
   most appropriate for your age group and will have the most success. There is not a specific time to utilize these
   items during a crisis. It must be a judgement call made when you feel the time is right. These items will require
   some prior planning and preparation.

3. Hand out lollipops, gum, and candy. This will give the kids something to do and may help the students to be quieter.

4. Have several large earphones ready for students with sensitive hearing.

5. There are small plugin earphones that can be purchased for a few dollars each as well as cheap devices that allow you
   to plug in numerous earphones into one phone. Therefore, one person can play music and everyone can listen.

6. Use fidget and squeezy toys to help students relieve stress and anxiety.

7. Keep several buckets ready for makeshift bathrooms. Clearing a school takes hours. Consider using a shower curtain
   for privacy. You can place hooks on the walls and use bungie cords to hold it up or have those holding it up look
   away.

8. Some schools keep a barrel in their classrooms and everything that may be needed for a crisis is kept inside it, out
   of view but ready. A barrel permits more items such as blankets, water, and even food/snacks to be ready if needed.

9. 2 boxes of baby wipes to clean faces and bodies.

10. First aid kits, gauze, and tourniquet.

11. 2 boxes of tissues.

12. If you’re on the second floor, consider a throw out ladder in case you need to climb down.

13. A small kid’s slide is an excellent way to help students with disabilities exit classroom windows. Chairs with
    rollers are also an easy and quick way to push students from the school.

I believe wholeheartedly that the more control you possess during extreme violence, even if it’s not very much, the less
you suffer later from PTSD. I know this to be true from firsthand experience. If we take steps right now to maintain
more control during a lockdown, even if it’s just a little bit more,
___we will lower or reduce the effects of post trauma.___

There is a 1% chance that you’ll ever need to use the suggestions in this article but a 100% chance that if you do need
them that they will help you and your students ___immeasurably___…now and in the future.
