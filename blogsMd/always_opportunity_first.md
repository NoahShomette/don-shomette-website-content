# Always Opportunity First

---

For a school attack to take place three elements must be present at the same time. If any one of these elements are not
present, violence will not occur. If all three of these elements are present simultaneously the crime, violence, or
attack will happen.

Those three elements are 1) __Desire__, 2) __Ability__, and 3) __Opportunity__.

### Desire:
How badly the person wants to do it?

### Ability:
Does the person have the skill set?

### Opportunity:
Does the person have the chance or opportunity to do it?

Of the three, which one do you think is the hardest to influence or eliminate? Which one is the easiest?

By far, __desire__ is the hardest to remove because it means getting inside a person’s head and making them no longer wish
for or desire something. That’s incredibly difficult, time consuming, and often complicated.

The easiest to remove is __opportunity__ because that’s totally up to you. It’s the quickest and usually the most effective
element to remove because you’re eliminating it yourself.

A couple of examples of how it all works together…

1. Lots of anti-bullying programs start with trying to get the bully to no longer want to hurt someone else. That’s __desire__
and it’s the hardest to influence. Instead, increase supervision of the students therefore removing the __opportunity__ for
it to happen. Should the bully still want to act it will require greater effort (__ability__).

2. You perfect your lockdown. A person attacks the school but teachers can lockdown all classrooms within 7 seconds. The
attacker desperately wants to get into the classrooms (__desire__) but can’t because the teachers have locked down (__no
opportunity__). He tries to kick the door open but can’t (__no ability__). The frames are made of steel and the doors are too
solid (__no opportunity__).

3. Every morning you stand outside and greet the students. You’re energized, engaged, and vigilant. 70% of all school
attackers are current or previous students. A student wants to attack the school (__desire__) but he sees you fully engaged
each morning. He knows that he must get by you and it won’t be easy (__reduced opportunity__). Therefore, he must do
something different so he begins to plan for a way around you.

4. In the case of Uvalde, a troubled and broken young person wanted to attack the school (__desire__). He had guns and the
__ability__ to use them. He was able to enter the building through an open door (__opportunity__).

5. You have a student who has made a threat to attack the school (__desire__). You begin a threat assessment and find the
student to be a danger to themselves and others (__desire & ability__). You begin to counsel, guide, and help the student.
Getting him to choose something else besides violence is difficult (__desire__). You implement an intervention and
management plan which has several requirements such as the student must arrive early before morning arrival, can’t ride
the bus, can’t carry a backpack, and must leave early each day (__removing/reducing opportunity__).

As you can see, reducing or removing __opportunity__ is the easiest and often the most effective because we have total
control over it and to remove it often requires small things like locking a door. As you consider your next steps to
make your school safer, ___always start first with removing opportunity___.

It doesn’t mean that you will or should ignore the other two elements. Working on one also impacts the other two.

If you remove __opportunity__, the person will have to delay in order to obtain a higher skill set (__ability__). This delay may
help to diminish their __desire__ since they can’t do it or don’t believe they will get away with it.

Either way, work first on removing ___opportunity___. Do the little things. Lock doors, perfect your lockdowns, engage with
your students and these efforts will reward you with big victories.
